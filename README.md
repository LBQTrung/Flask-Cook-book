## Usage
You should have some experience with the Python programming language and a basic understanding of computer networks to comfortably navigate through this book. Additionally, knowledge of object-oriented programming and databases may facilitate a quicker comprehension while reading. Most of the commands in the example sections of the theoretical chapters will be thoroughly explained, along with the underlying concepts to form a solid understanding.

For the practical project sections, I will explain things at a fundamental level, aiming to equip you with the ability to seek information when you encounter challenges or lack understanding of certain processes. What sets this book apart from others is the inclusion of detailed system analysis and design before proceeding with the construction and deployment of the project.
